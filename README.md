## what does this do?

This CLI tool allows you to search NASA's public images API for a search term and downloads the original images. I build this because I was tired of seeing the same old desktop pictures. Using this tool you get to download a set of images for each search term and then you can use these images as desktop pictures. *TADA!*, now you can get dopamine hit whenever you see a new picture on your desktop.

## how do I use this?

* ````$ npm install -g simple-nasa-image-downloader````
* ````$ nasa-images-download <search term>````
* your images will download in the current directory under the images folder.
